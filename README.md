## What does it doooo?
Notifies you when a Countdown online grocery order time slot becomes available in your area (no more manual checking) ðŸ’…

## Why?
Covid 19 online order queues are not gucci.

## How to use

1. clone repo
2. `nvm use`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn disappointUrself ponsonby 10` (check countdown delivery for ponsonby area every 10 minutes). You will be notified of that area's delivery status. I.e. do they have a deliver slot available literally anywhere (sigh). Change suburb or interval accordingly.
