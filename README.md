## What does it do?
Notifies you when a Countdown online grocery order time slot becomes available in your area (no more manual checking) üíÖ

## Why?
Covid 19 online order queues are not gucci.

## Disclaimer
Please don't panic buy ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## How to use

1. clone repo
2. `nvm use` (or otherwise set node version to 14)
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn disappointUrself 'eden terrace' 10` (check countdown delivery for Eden Terrace area every 10 minutes). You will be notified of that area's delivery status. I.e. do they have a deliver slot available literally anywhere (sigh). Change suburb or interval accordingly.

You can see what the headless browser is seeing by looking at `latest-screenshot-final.png` in the root dir (resets this snapshot before asserting on every loop).
